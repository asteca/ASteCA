[<b>A</b>utomated <b>Ste</b>llar <b>C</b>luster <b>A</b>nalysis][3].

The <b>A</b>utomated <b>Ste</b>llar <b>C</b>luster <b>A</b>nalysis (ASteCA) package is designed to fully automatize the usual tests applied on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_cluster">star clusters</a> in order to determine their characteristics: center, radius, stars' membership probabilities and associated intrinsic/extrinsic parameters: metallicity, age, reddening, distance, total mass, binarity fraction, etc.</p>
