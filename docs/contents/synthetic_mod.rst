Synthetic module
################

The :py:class:`asteca.Synthetic` class allows generating synthetic clusters from:

1. A :py:class:`asteca.Isochrones` object
2. A dictionary of fundamental parameters
3. A :py:class:`asteca.Cluster` object (optional, used for calibration)

The handling of a :class:`synthetic` object is explained in detail in the sub-sections
that follow.


.. _ref_defining:

Defining the object
*******************

To instantiate a :class:`synthetic` object you need to pass the :class:`isochs`
object previously generated, as explained in the section :ref:`isochrones_module`.

.. code-block:: python

    # Synthetic clusters object
    synthcl = asteca.Synthetic(isochs)

This will perform the required initial processing and load the theoretical isochrones
into the :class:`synthcl` object. The processing involves sampling an initial
mass function (IMF), setting the distributions for the binary systems' mass ratio,
and the differential reddening (these two last processes are optional).

The basic example above uses the default values for these three processes, but
they can be modified by the user at this stage via their arguments. These arguments
are (also see :py:class:`asteca.Synthetic`):

.. code-block:: console

    ext_law          : Extinction law
    DR_distribution  : Distribution for the differential reddening
    IMF_name         : Initial mass function
    max_mass         : Maximum total initial mass
    gamma            : Distribution for the mass ratio of the binary systems

The ``ext_law`` argument defines the extinction law as one of either ``CCMO`` or
``GAIADR3``. The first one corresponds to the model by
`Cardelli, Clayton & Mathis (1989)`_, with updated coefficients for near-UV from
`O'Donnell (1994)`_. The second one is `Gaia's (E)DR3`_, color-dependent law (main
sequence), only applicable to Gaia's photometry. If this law is selected, **ASteCA**
assumes that the magnitude and first color used are Gaia's ``G`` and ``BP-RP``
respectively. 

.. important::

    While ``CCMO`` allows different ``Rv`` values (which means this parameter can even
    be fitted), ``GAIADR3`` is to be used with ``Rv=3.1``. Please read the online
    documentation and its accompanying articles  to learn more about this law's
    limitations.

There are dedicated packages like `dustapprox`_, `dust_extinction`_ or `extinction`_
that can handle this process. We chose to employ our own implementation to increase the
performance. If you want to use a different extinction model, please drop me an
`email <mailto:gabrielperren@gmail.com>`_.


The ``DR_distribution`` argument fixes the distribution used for the differential
reddening (assuming that the ``DR`` parameter is different than 0, see Section
:ref:`ref_generating`). The differential reddening effect adds a random amount to the
total extinction parameter ``Av``, sampled from either a `uniform`_ or a `normal`_
distribution. The ``DR_distribution`` argument hence accepts one of two string values:
``uniform`` (the default) or ``normal``.


The ``IMF_name`` and ``max_mass`` arguments are used to generate random mass samples from
an IMF. To improve the performance of the code, this step is performed when the
:py:class:`asteca.Synthetic` object is created instead of every time a new synthetic
cluster is generated. The ``IMF_name`` argument must be one of those available in
:py:class:`asteca.Synthetic`: ``salpeter_1955, kroupa_2001, chabrier_2014``.
Currently these are associated to the following IMFs:

.. figure:: ../_static/IMFs.webp
    :scale: 35%
    :align: center

as defined in `Salpeter (1995)`_, `Kroupa (2001)`_, and `Chabrier et al. (2014)`_
(currently the default value). The ``max_mass`` argument simply fixes the total mass
value to be sampled. This value should be large enough to allow generating as many
synthetic stars as those present in the observed cluster. The default value is
:math:`10000\;M_{\odot}` which should be more than enough for the vast majority of
clusters.

The ``gamma`` argument (:math:`\gamma`) defines the distribution of the mass ratio for
the binary systems. The mass ratio is the ratio of secondary masses (:math:`m_2`)
to primary masses (:math:`m_1`) in binary systems, written as
:math:`q=m_2/m_1\,(<=1)`. As with the IMF, the :math:`q` distribution is fixed, not
fitted, to improve the performance.

We use ``gamma`` as an argument because the :math:`q` distribution is usually defined
as a power-law, where ``gamma`` or :math:`\gamma` is the exponent or power:

.. math::

    f(q) \approx q^{\gamma(m_1)}

Here, :math:`f(q)` is the distribution of :math:`q` (the mass-ratio) where 
:math:`\gamma(m_1)` means that the value of :math:`\gamma` depends on the primary mass
of the system (this dependence is only true for the `Duchene & Kraus (2013)`_
distribution, see below).

The default selection is ``gamma=D&K``, with ``D&K`` meaning the primary mass-dependent
distribution by `Duchene & Kraus (2013)`_ (see their Table 1 and Figure 3). The user
can also select between the two distributions by `Fisher et al. (2005)`_ (stepped
and peaked, see their Table 3) and `Raghavan et al. (2010)`_ (see their Fig 16,
left). In practice they all look somewhat similar, as shown in the figure below for a
random IMF mass sampling.

.. figure:: ../_static/qdist_mass.webp
    :scale: 35%
    :align: center

The Fisher distributions (top row) favor :math:`q` values closer to unity (i.e.:
secondary masses that are similar to the primary masses), while the Raghavan and
Duchene & Kraus distributions (bottom row) look a bit more uniform.

The user can also select a float value for ``gamma``, which will be used as an
exponent in the power-law function :math:`f(q) \approx q^{\gamma}`. The figure below
shows this distribution for three ``gamma`` (:math:`\gamma`) values, where ``gamma=0``
means a uniform distribution.

.. figure:: ../_static/qdist_unif.webp
    :scale: 35%
    :align: center

Only the Duchene & Kraus distribution is primary-mass dependent. The Fisher and Raghavan
distributions, as well as the distributions set by the user via a float value for
``gamma``, are independent of mass values.

.. _ref_calibrating:

Calibrating
***********

The calibration process is applied after instantiating a :class:`asteca.Synthetic`
object, named here :obj:`synthcl` as described in the previous section. This process
is optional and it is aimed at collecting data from an observed cluster loaded in
a :py:class:`asteca.Cluster` object (which we name here :obj:`my_cluster`, see
:ref:`cluster_module`).

The calibration is performed via the :py:meth:`asteca.Synthetic.calibrate` method:

.. code-block:: python

    # Synthetic cluster calibration
    synthcl.calibrate(my_cluster)


This will extract the following information from the observed cluster:

- maximum observed photometric magnitude
- number of observed stars
- distribution of photometric uncertainties

The algorithm employed by **ASteCA** is to simply transport the observed uncertainty
values in magnitude and color(s) to the generated synthetic stars. This way no
approximation to the distribution of photometric uncertainties is required.

As stated, this process is optional. The user can generate synthetic clusters without
calibrating the :obj:`synthcl` object. In this case, the synthetic clusters will be
generated with a given number of observed stars (default value is 100 but the user can
select any other value), the maximum photometric magnitude allowed by the loaded
isochrones, and no photometric uncertainties added. The following section explains this
process in more detail.




.. _ref_generating:

Generating
**********

To generate synthetic clusters the user is required to pass a dictionary with
fundamental parameters to the :py:meth:`asteca.Synthetic.generate` method.
**ASteCA** currently requires eight parameters, related to the following intrinsic and
extrinsic cluster characteristics:

- *Intrinsic*: metallicity (``met``), age (``loga``), and binarity (``alpha, beta``)
- *Extrinsic*: distance modulus (``dm``) and extinction related parameters (total
  extinction ``Av``, differential reddening ``DR``, ratio of total to selective
  extinction ``Rv``)

These eight parameters are described in more depth in the following sub-sections.
**ASteCA** also allows estimating the cluster's mass and binary fraction for an
observed cluster. This process is optional and requires dictionaries with fitted
fundamental parameters and their STDDEVS (see :ref:`masses_and_binarity` for more
details).

An example of the dictionary of parameters used for the generation of a synthetic
cluster is shown below, applied to a previously defined :obj:`synthcl` object:

.. code-block:: python

    # Define model parameters
    params = {
        "met": 0.01,
        "loga": 9.87,
        "alpha": 0.01,
        "beta": 1.,
        "Rv": 3.1,
        "dm": 11.3,
        "Av": 0.15,
        "DR": 0.2,
    }

    # Generate the synthetic cluster
    synth_clust = synthcl.generate(params)

The returned ``synth_clust`` variable will hold a ``numpy`` array with the synthetic
cluster data. The notebook :ref:`synth_ntbk` contains more information and examples
on how to generate and process synthetic clusters with **ASteCA**.


.. important::

    The :py:class:`asteca.Synthetic` class includes a ``def_params`` argument with
    a dictionary of default values for all the fundamental parameters. This means
    that the user could call ``synthcl.generate()`` with no ``params`` dictionary,
    and the method will still generate a synthetic cluster. This also allows the
    user to pass a ``params`` dictionary with only a few parameters
    (e.g.: ``params={"met": 0.02, "dm": 12.7}``), and the remaining parameters will
    inherit the default values. More details in :ref:`synth_ntbk`.




Intrinsic parameters
====================

The valid ranges for the metallicity and logarithmic age are inherited from the
theoretical isochrone(s) loaded in the :py:class:`asteca.Isochrones` object.

The metallicity, ``met``, can be modeled either as ``z`` or (logarithmic) ``FeH`` as
explained in section :ref:`isochrones_module`. The age parameter, ``loga``, is modeled
as the logarithmic age.

The ``alpha, beta`` parameters determine the fraction of binary systems
in a synthetic cluster through the equation:

.. math::

    P_b(m_1) = \alpha + \beta \times \frac{m_1}{(1.4+m_1)}

where :math:`P_b(m_1)` is the probability that a star of (primary) mass :math:`m_1` is
part of a binary system. This equation comes from a fit to the multiplicity fraction
presented in `Offner et al. (2023)`_ (see their Fig. 1 and Table 1). The multiplicity
fraction values in this work are primary mass dependent, meaning that larger masses
have much larger probabilities of being part of a binary (or higher order) system than
low mass stars.

The values ``alpha=0.09, beta=0.94`` produce a very reasonable fit to this multiplicity
fraction distribution:

.. figure:: ../_static/binar_distr.webp
    :scale: 35%
    :align: center

These are thus suggested as fixed values for the ``alpha, beta`` parameters. The user
can of course choose to fit either or both of them, or fix them to different values. For
example, fixing ``alpha=0.5, beta=0.0`` would produce a synthetic cluster with
approximately 50% of binary systems, distributed uniformly across masses 
(i.e.: not primary mass dependent).


.. _Offner et al. (2023): https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ASPC..534..275O





Extrinsic parameters
====================

The extrinsic parameters are related to two external processes affecting stellar
clusters: their distance and the extinction associated to their line of sight. The
distance is measured by the distance modulus ``dm``, which is the amount added to the
photometric magnitude to position the cluster at the proper distance from us. 

The three remaining parameters are linked to the extinction process: the total
extinction ``Av``, the ratio of total to selective extinction ``Rv``, and the
differential reddening ``DR``.

The first two are related through the equation:

.. math::

    A_V = R_V \times E_{B-V}

Finally, the differential reddening parameter ``DR`` adds random scatter to the cluster
stars affected by ``Av``. The distribution for this scatter is controlled setting the
argument ``DR_distribution`` when the :obj:`synthetic` object is instantiated (as
explained in :ref:`ref_defining`), which can currently be either a uniform or a
normal distribution.






.. _masses_and_binarity:

Mass and binarity
*****************

Using methods available in the :py:class:`asteca.Synthetic` class, we can estimate
for an observed cluster:

- The individual stellar masses and their probability of being binary systems,
- the total binary fraction of the cluster, and 
- the different masses associated to the cluster

The :ref:`masses_bfr_ntbk` tutorial contains more details and examples on how to
perform these analyses.

Regarding the cluster masses, **ASteCA** estimates several different masses for the
cluster, as explained below.

The total initial mass of a cluster can be split in several parts, as follows:

.. math::
    :label: eq_Mi1

    M_{i} = M_{a} + M_{evol} + M_{dyn}

where :math:`M_{i}` is the initial mass, :math:`M_{a}` is the actual mass,
:math:`M_{evol}` is the mass **lost** via stellar evolution, and :math:`M_{dyn}` is
the mass **lost** through dynamical effects (or *dissolution*). The actual mass
:math:`M_{a}` can be further split as:

.. math::

    M_{a} = M_{obs} + M_{phot}

where :math:`M_{obs}` is the observed mass (e.g.: the sum of individual stellar masses
in the observed CMD) and :math:`M_{phot}` is the mass **unobserved** due to photometric
effects (i.e: the low mass stars beyond the maximum magnitude cut). The total initial
mass can thus be written as the sum of all of its components as:

.. math::

    M_{i} = M_{obs} + M_{phot} + M_{evol} + M_{dyn}

The actual mass :math:`M_{a}` is estimated by **ASteCA** combining the observed and
photometric masses. The observed mass :math:`M_{obs}` is approximated as the sum of the
individual stellar masses of many synthetic clusters, sampled with parameters
matching those of the observed cluster. The photometric mass :math:`M_{phot}` is inferred
by summing the mass that exists below the mass value associated to the maximum observed
magnitude in the cluster. This requires sampling an IMF with a very large mass, and
obtaining the ratio of :math:`M_{obs}` to total mass; this ratio is the applied to the
sum of masses below the mass cut in the IMF to estimate :math:`M_{phot}`.
As stated above, the sum of these two masses is equivalent to :math:`M_{a}`.

Following `Lamers et al. (2005)
<https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2005/37/aa2241-04/aa2241-04.html>`_ Eq. 7,
the initial mass can be estimated via:

.. math::
    :label: eq_Mi2

    M_i \simeq \left\{ M_a^{\gamma} + \frac{\gamma t}{t_0} \right\}^{1/\gamma} \mu_{\text
    {evol}}(Z, t)^{-1}

where :math:`M_{a}` is the actual mass, :math:`t` is the cluster's age,
:math:`\mu_{\text{evol}}(Z, t)` is the "*fraction of the initial mass of the cluster that
would have remained at age t, if stellar evolution would have been the only mass
loss mechanism*", :math:`{\gamma}` is a constant, and :math:`t_{0}` is "*a constant that
depends on the tidal field of the particular galaxy in which the cluster moves and on
the ellipticity of its orbit*".

The :math:`\gamma` constant is usually set to 0.62 and the
:math:`\mu_{\text{evol}}(Z, t)` parameter can be estimated using a 3rd degree polynomial
as shown in 
`Lamers, Baumgardt & Gieles (2010) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.409..305L>`_,
Table B2.

The dissolution parameter :math:`t_0` of a cluster is the hypothetical dissolution
time-scale of a cluster of 1 :math:`M_{\odot}` and is related to the disruption time
:math:`t_{dis}` (defined as the time when 5% of the initial number of stars remain in
the cluster) via:

.. math::

    t_{dis} = t_{0} M_i^{\gamma}

Furthermore, :math:`t_0` is expected to depend on the ambient density
:math:`\rho_{amb}` at the location of the clusters in the Galaxy as:

.. math::

    t_{0} = C_{env} (1-\epsilon) 10^{-4\gamma} \rho_{amb}^{-1/2}

where :math:`C_{env}` is a constant set to 810 Myr (`Lamers, Gieles & Zwart 2005
<https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2005/01/aa1476/aa1476.html>`_),
:math:`\epsilon` is the eccentricity of the orbit, and :math:`\rho_{amb}` is the ambient
density which depends on the adopted gravitational potential field.

Following `Angelo et al. (2023)
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.522..956A/abstract>`_, **ASteCA** uses by
default :math:`\epsilon=0.08` and estimates :math:`\rho_{amb}` as:

.. math::

    \rho_{\text{amb}} = \frac{1}{4\pi G} \nabla^2 \left[ \phi_B(r) + \phi_D(\rho, z) + \phi_H(r) \right]

where :math:`\phi_B(r),\, \phi_D(\rho, z),\, \phi_H(r)` are the bulge, disc and halo
potentials, respectively (see Eqs 8, 9 and 10 of the Angelo et al. article to see how
these are modeled). The user can also use a custom :math:`\rho_{\text{amb}}` value,
bypassing this estimation.

Plugging these values into Eq :eq:`eq_Mi2`, we can obtain an estimate of :math:`M_{i}`.
With this value we can then obtain :math:`M_{evol}` through the
:math:`\mu_{\text{evol}}(Z, t)` parameter as:

.. math::

    M_{evol} = M_{i}  \times [1 - \mu_{\text{evol}}(Z, t)]

Finally, the last remaining mass is the dynamical mass which we estimate simply
using Eq :eq:`eq_Mi1` as:

.. math::

    M_{dyn} = M_{i} - M_{a} - M_{evol}

The distributions for these masses are obtained through a bootstrap process that
takes the uncertainties in the fundamental parameters into account.
