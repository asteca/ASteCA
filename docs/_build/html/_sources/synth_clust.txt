Synthetic clusters
==================

The process by which synthetic clusters are generated by ``ASteCA``
is described in the sections that follow.

IMF sampling
------------

The initial mass function (IMF) is the distribution of initial masses
for a population of stars. For a population of :math:`N` stars with
masses :math:`m_i` and a total mass of :math:`M_T`:

.. math::
 IMF \, &\rightarrow \, \xi(m)=\frac{dn}{dm} \, \rightarrow \,dn = \xi(m)dm \\
 M_T &= \sum_{i=1}^N m_i \, \rightarrow \, M_T = C\int_{m_l}^{m_h} m(n)dn = \\
 &= C\int_{m_l}^{m_h} m\xi(m)dm

where :math:`m_l` and :math:`m_h` are the mass limits for the IMF
(:math:`m_h` is fixed to :math:`100 M_{\odot}` in the code) and
:math:`C` is a normalization constant. Setting the total mass to unity,
:math:`M_T=1 M_{\odot}`, allows us to obtain the normalization constant
:math:`C_1` and treat the normalized IMF as a PDF:

.. math::
 M_T=1M_{\odot}\, \rightarrow \, C_1 = \frac{1}{\int_{m_l}^{m_h} m\xi(m)dm}

and thus the normalized IMF can be written as:

.. math::
 PDF(m) = \xi(m)_{norm} = C_1 \xi(m)

This is the first step, performed by the ``get-IMF-PDF`` function for
a given selected IMF (Chabrier 2001, Kroupa et al. 1993, Kroupa 2002)

Once the PDF is generated, every time a new synthetic cluster is created
the ``get-mass-dist`` function is called from within ``synth-cluster``.
This former function takes the PDF and samples a number of masses
randomly from it, following the probabilities distribution given by the
PDF, until the mass fixed by the ``total-mass`` parameter is achieved.

The ``get-mass-dist`` function thus returns a distribution of masses
probabilistically sampled from a certain IMF, whose masses sum up to a
total cluster mass.
