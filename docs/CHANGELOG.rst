`[v0.1.9] <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/releases/tag/v0.1.9>`__ - 2015-06-18
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

(**Warning**: this release breaks compatibility with the previous
version of the ``params_input.dat`` & ``semi_input.dat`` files)

-  Models (ie: isochrone + extinction +distance modulus + mass
   distribution + binarity) are now evaluated *each time the GA selects
   them as a solution*, thus a new mass distribution is generated
   (`#186 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/issues/186>`__). This has a
   performance cost, but provides higher accuracy in the best model
   assignment process since a single model can now be evaluated with a
   slightly different mass distribution several times (only with GA,
   *Brute Force* method will only process a model once).
-  Added an *exit switch* to the decontamination algorithm. It will stop
   iterations if the MPs converged to 0.1% tolerance values for all the
   stars in the cluster region (compared to the previous iteration).
   This speeds up the function considerably
   (`#185 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/issues/185>`__).
-  The upper mass value in the IMF can now be `modified via the input
   parameters
   file <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/commit/4b1a897d69cf85b1c0263d738cf2132d9924eb9c>`__.
-  Code can now read ``params_input_XX.dat`` files when `using lazy
   parallelization <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/commit/f2508355d8136c2d5a6216093e6f9eda02bd99c1>`__.
-  Number of field regions `can now be set
   individually <https://github.com/asteca/ASteCA/commit/dc4c9223b0ec0a02904e30025eec50dfdc13637d>`__
   via the ``semi_input.dat`` file.
-  `Added ‘bb’ binning
   method <https://github.com/asteca/ASteCA/commit/d35c5611708d249e730bef77b0ee14226cce14de>`__
   based on `Bonnato & Bica
   (2007) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007MNRAS.377.1301B>`__. Sets
   bin widths of 0.25 and 0.5 for colors and magnitudes respectively.
-  Fixed bug in ``manual`` mode when `displaying
   errors <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/commit/2e4b1d8f8a084e78bc56d52df494a796a6909de6>`__.
-  Fixed bug when narrow frames were plotted
   (`#168 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/issues/168>`__).
-  Moved text box outside of synthetic cluster’s plot to improve its
   visibility (`#205 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/issues/205>`__).
-  Closed `#13 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/issues/13>`__. Saha’s W
   likelihood needs the number of model points to be fixed, which
   prevents it from being used when the mass varies. There’s nothing to
   be gained by adding this function.
-  Caveat dragged from version
   `0.1.2 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/releases/tag/v0.1.2>`__ is
   `resolved <https://github.com/asteca/ASteCA/commit/ff3b240ec3d1b2339ce51cf262e71810a33b6517>`__.


`[v0.1.8] <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/releases/tag/v0.1.8>`__ - 2015-04-09
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

(**Warning**: this release breaks compatibility with the previous
version of the ``params_input.dat`` file)

-  Added ``local`` and ``mp_05`` methods to the selection of which stars
   to use in the best fit cluster parameter assignation process
   (`#180 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/issues/180>`__,
   `#183 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/issues/183>`__).
-  Added an *automatic update checker* function that notifies the user
   if an updated version of ``ASteCA`` is available for download
   (`#179 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/issues/179>`__).
-  Added grid lines over the photometric diagrams of the observed and
   synthetic cluster, showing the binning made by the method selected in
   each case (`#131 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/issues/131>`__).
-  Best fit synthetic cluster found is now saved to file
   (`#154 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/issues/154>`__).
-  Correctly obtain approximate number of members (``n_memb``) and
   contamination index (``CI``) when the cluster radius extends beyond
   the RDP, thus making the field star density value (``field_dens``)
   unreliable (`#111 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/issues/111>`__).
-  Added ``f10`` flag to alert when the ``memb_par`` value is greater
   than +-0.33, which means that there are twice as many estimated true
   members in either method
   (`#175 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/issues/175>`__).
-  Improved ``top_tiers`` plotting and saved file
   (`#184 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/issues/184>`__).

   method <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/commit/6b2857aefa2878ee5aba245a7fbf9cc1f423820b>`__,
   now uses *prediction bands* instead of *confidence intervals*.

   rejection <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/commit/d92be0c8e398739fba562d59ba35b11eeac9a9a0>`__.

-  Added `SDSS
   CMDs <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/commit/2324a70f402ddbe9fdde203c3745f93b6d6dc545>`__
   ``g vs (u-g)`` & ``g vs (g-r)``, at the request of Tjibaria Pijloo
   (Department of Astrophysics, Radboud University Nijmegen).
-  Fixed bug in binarity generation for the CMDs of the form
   ``X vs (X-Y)``
   (`#181 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/issues/181>`__).
-  Smarter selection of stars to be used by the best fit function,
   improvements in several plots
   (`#171 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/issues/171>`__,
   `#172 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/issues/172>`__).
-  Best fit function can now accept a *minimum magnitude* value instead
   of just a *minimum probability* value
   (`#115 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/issues/115>`__).
-  Added a ``memb_par`` parameter to compare the number of approximate
   cluster members obtained via the structural analysis and via the
   decontamination algorithm
   (`#162 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/issues/162>`__).
-  Code is now able to correctly read the names of files with `more than
   one dot in it’s
   name <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/commit/c0358ed9526b835bfeeddf75804002ad51c69610>`__.

`[v0.1.1] <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/releases/tag/v0.1.1>`__ - 2014-11-07

   to error function.
-  Closed *Known issues* from previous version.


**Caveats**

-  Same as previous version.


`[v0.1.0] <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/releases/tag/v0.1.0>`__ - 2014-10-08
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

*First semi-stable buggy release*

-  Closed `#72 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/issues/72>`__,
   `#99 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/issues/99>`__,
   `#37 <https://github.com/asteca/asteca/issues/37>`__.
-  Changed the way the IMF was
   `sampled <https://github.com/Gabriel-p/asteca/commit/0671e74c52fbecde6bcbb1afb1c2624875156e57>`__,
   now it should be faster and more precise.
-  Some speed improvements (moved things around mainly).
-  Binary fraction is now a free parameter.

**Known issues**

-  **Serious bug**: if the DA is set to run but the *Best fit method*
   isn’t, the final plot can’t be produced since the ``syn_cl_err``
   function isn’t used
   (`fixed <https://github.com/Gabriel-p/asteca/commit/3e806bd0af5d7fcd7c8f2940716df880f4c1b67d>`__
   in next release).
-  Forgotten ``print`` prints out mass values every time the E/I
   operator is applied
   (`fixed <https://github.com/Gabriel-p/asteca/commit/8b313ef60fddccc41fd6fb7b9746f75f3e867d39>`__
   in next release).
-  If the number of points (``n_left``) in the radius finding function
   is smaller than 4, a very small radius is likely to be selected.
   `Fixed <https://github.com/Gabriel-p/asteca/commit/c247fd7fa4cca4d6bb341263434a4a43a4778efd>`__
   in next release.


**Caveats**

-  The total initial mass can be set as a free parameter but the
   likelihood function will select always synthetic clusters of high
   mass. Thus it is advised to leave this parameter fixed to 1000 solar
   masses.
-  The binary fraction found is not stored in the output data file.
-  Some density map plots for mass and binary fraction are missing.
